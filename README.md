using OpenUnmix.

## Installation

### Using the installer

If you are under Windows and don’t know how to use pip (see below), you can use the latest `yaas_installer.exe` in https://github.com/kleag/yaas/releases

You must also install ffmpeg. It seems that the simplest way to do so under Windows is with winget (winget is installed by default on Windows 11, and can be installed using the Windows Store on previous versions).

To install ffmpeg with winget, start PowerShell, and then run:

```
winget install ffmpeg
```


### Using pip

```bash
pip install yaas
```

If you are under Windows, you will have to ensure to have a working python installation and to have ffmpeg installed.

## Usage

### Starting the application

#### When installed with the Windows installer

Search yaas in your installed applications and start it.

#### When installed with pip

Just run

```
yaas
```

### Using Yaas

Search the video from which you want to extract the sound tracks using the
integrated browser, click the Start button, wait (it can be long), and then use
the generated audio files. Those are put by default in `$HOME/yaas_tracks`. You
can change the destination dir with the `--out` option.

If you want to interrupt an extraction, just click the `Stop` button that
replaces the `Start` button during work.

Note that you must respect the copyright of the authors. E.g., If they don't
authorize sharing, you must keep your private copy for you.

## Building and distributing

```bash
git commit
bumpver update --patch
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```


### Under Windows

```
pyinstaller .\yaas.spec
 & 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe' .\inno_setup_script.iss
```
